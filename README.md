A skilled Software Developer with formidable experience in graphic design and motion graphics. I'm passionate about coding, language agnostic and advocate for lifelong learning and exploring new technologies. Beside self-learning I have done a few bootcamps/courses, like: [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy)- a bootcamp specifically focused on the Agile Methodology and Extreme Programming values such as pair-programming and TDD with Ruby and Rails, Javascript and express among other technologies. I've also trained on the [Free Boot Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com) in parallel which was more focused on front-end design, JavaScript and jQuery.<br>

I'm currently looking for job, preferebly in London (but I'm open to relocating based on offers) where I'll get the opportunity to develop and add to my skill set.
<!-- I have worked for the past 4 month at Capgemini's Applied Innovation Exchange where I worked on a varaierty of devise projects built with different technologies and helped run Design Sprints on-site for high profile clients such as Nationwide Group. -->

> *"Sal has worked for the ASE and AIE at Capgemini for the past 3 months.
I Had the opportunity to collaborate with him on several projects and witnessed his professional attitude, his attention to detail and his large set of skills.
Sal and I did some research on the use of digital in retail and healthcare and I was impressed by the depth of his knowledge and the sophistication of his final delivery.
I also had the chance to witness his skills and knowledge in technology and video editing: Sal has the ability to venture and discover new software, learn and adjust fast in order to deliver the best result.
I recommend his work and input and look forward to future collaborations.
